After analyzing GDP data of a whole lot of nations, I have drawn some interesting conclusions. some of them are - 
1) Countries showed a greater freedom index when compared to others when their Trade and Financial freedom were higher. This resulted in a higher GDP over the years contributing to the ultimate increase in the index.
2)  Nations with highest population numbers suffered in the freedom index study and were on the lesser side of the economic index scale.
